				Root beer is a nice drink. Right now it is night and I am tpying content for 
				this assignment. Guess what. What? Chicken butt. My glasses is black and green. 
				The sofas are black and white. There is an apple macbook right be side me. Apple 
				decided to remove the 3.5mm audio jack which was a really bold move that many people 
				did not like. Penguins are very cute and are my favourite animals. I decided to bring 
				my laptop to the dining room because I do not want to be in my room. I bought a text 
				book for 40 dollars to share with a friend in the same course. The same friend bought 
				me a jacket to repay for the book. I had a Jimmy the Greek for dinner and it was quite 
				enjoyable.
