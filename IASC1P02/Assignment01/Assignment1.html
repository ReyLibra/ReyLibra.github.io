			<h3>Wow Paragraph 1</h3>
			<p>
				Root beer is a nice drink. Right now it is night and I am tpying content for this assignment. Guess what. What? <strong>Chicken butt</strong>. My glasses is black and green. The sofas are black and white. There is an apple macbook right be side me. Apple decided to remove the 3.5mm audio jack which was a really bold move that many people did not like. Penguins are very cute and are my favourite animals. I decided to bring my laptop to the dining room because I do not want to be in my room. I bought a text book for 40 dollars to share with a friend in the same course. The same friend bought me a jacket to <em>repay</em> for the book. I had a Jimmy the Greek for dinner and it was quite enjoyable.
